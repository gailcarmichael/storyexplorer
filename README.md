# Story Explorer
Story Explorer is a work-in-progress story-game engine. The project is part of my PhD thesis project on [creating a sense of coherence in open-world adventure and RPG games](http://gailcarmichael.com/research/projects/emergentstories).

Currently, the easiest way to run the example game Accidental Prophet (also a work in progress) is as follows:
* Download and install [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) for Java development ([Mars](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/mars2) and [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) are known to work).
* Clone this repository.
* Run Eclipse, and set the workspace as the folder that contains `storyexplorer`.
* Under the `game.ui` package, right click the `StoryExplorerApplet.java` file and "Run As... Application" (not an applet, despite the name).
