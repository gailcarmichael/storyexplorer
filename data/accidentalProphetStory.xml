It was not a gradual transformation, like the onset of Spring, but rather a stark departure from one ethereal dreamscape to another. With the remnants of your seconds-dead dream falling to shreds around you, you stepped forward into the piercing-pure light of the dawnâ€™s sun, you understood with a sudden clarity why you had been chosen, what was expected of you, and the great hope that had been planted in the fertile earth just ahead of you. The future is budding with possibilities, and you have  been chosen to play the part of the gardener transcendentâ€”to guide, to foster, to reap and sow, to prune and trim as befits their splendour. This vision was granted to you and you alone, and it is only you who can see it to fruition.</eventText>

A gust of wind toys with the sea of tall grass, and suddenly you are granted a glimpse at the things that could be, the things that will be, and even some things that mightâ€™ve been. Cities rise from the ground, their cobbled streets and shingled rooves willed into being by the sheer strength of your devotion to the divine majesty with which you commune. This wonder can persist, can withstand the test of timeâ€”all you need to do is spread the word, live in accordance with the tenants you have been shown. Most of all, though, you must never, ever doubt, never waver. Even the most steadfast of citadels will crumble, if the foundation is not sound.</eventText>

The trees know that the time for sleep is near, and the conflagration of oranges, reds and yellows they display mark their final arboreal celebration. The husks of dead leaves slither and rustle along the ground, just the first to fall in the cold months ahead. This flame that was entrusted to you, you have succeeded in tending to it, nurturing it from a mere spark to the roaring bonfire it is today. The fierce dread of winter marches ever closer, though, brining with it the numbing frost and frigid death it is best known forâ€”will your fire burn bright enough to wait out this creeping season?
